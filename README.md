# cloudMonkey

> Cloud is not safe...

cloudMonkey is a lightweight Python project for working with cloud-related tasks. This repository currently contains the project skeleton, documentation, and development helpers. Use this README as a living document â€” fill in project-specific details (features, usage, examples) as the project grows.

If you'd like a version tailored to a specific purpose (cloud scanner, automation toolkit, SDK wrapper, etc.), tell me what cloudMonkey does and I will update the README with concrete examples.

## What is cloudMonkey?

cloudMonkey is a Python project intended to help with cloud-related workflows. The tagline "Cloud is not safe..." is a reminder to treat cloud systems with an appropriate security mindset.

This README provides:
- A clear onboarding path for developers and users.
- Installation and usage examples.
- Guidance for contributing and testing.

> NOTE: Replace this section with a short paragraph describing the project's purpose, core responsibilities, and intended users (e.g., "cloudMonkey is a cloud configuration auditing tool" or "cloudMonkey is a small CLI for interacting with X cloud provider").

## Features

- Project skeleton and development tooling
- Installation instructions for local development
- Placeholder for usage examples and CLI/API docs

(Replace the above with actual features once implemented. Example feature items:
- "Scan S3 buckets for public access"
- "Enumerate and report IAM policies"
- "Provision common resources with templates")

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (adjust as needed)
- pip
- Virtual environment recommended (venv, virtualenv, or Conda)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/RicheByte/cloudMonkey.git
cd cloudMonkey

# create and activate venv (POSIX)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# or on Windows (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install (if requirements.txt present)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or install editable for development
pip install -e .
```

If you publish cloudMonkey on PyPI or have a package name, replace the editable install above with:
```bash
pip install cloudMonkey
```

## Quick start

Below are example usage patterns. Replace these with real commands or API examples:

CLI (example):
```bash
# Example CLI command (replace with real CLI once implemented)
cloudmonkey scan --target my-account --output report.json
```

Python (example import):
```python
from cloudmonkey import scanner

result = scanner.run_scan("my-account")
print(result.summary())
```

## Configuration

Describe configuration options, environment variables, and credentials. Example:

- CLOUDMONKEY_CONFIG: path to config file (default: ~/.cloudmonkey/config.yaml)
- CLOUDMONKEY_API_KEY: API key for provider (if applicable)
- CLOUDMONKEY_REGION: Default cloud region

Provide a sample config file (config.yaml):
```yaml
# Example config
api_key: "REPLACE_ME"
region: "us-east-1"
output: "report.json"
```

## Development

Recommended workflow for contributors:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```
2. Run linters and formatters (add relevant tools):
   ```bash
   # Example using flake8 and black
   black .
   flake8
   ```
3. Run tests (see Testing section below).
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Include any project-specific pre-commit hooks or CI notes here.

## Testing

Describe how to run tests locally. Example:
```bash
# if tests use pytest
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

Add test coverage tools and instructions to generate reports:
```bash
# coverage example
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A simple guide:

- Read the code of conduct (if you add one)
- Open an issue to discuss major changes
- Use clear, focused commits and pull requests
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep the README and docs up to date with any public API or command changes

Add a CONTRIBUTING.md and ISSUE_TEMPLATE(s) to the repository for more structure.
